# Toy_programs
This repository has the some of toy projects I'd done.<br>
They are either school assignments, projects done with friends or by myself.<br>
Some other projects not in this repo are linked in this readme document.

The list of main practices are
- `jupyter notebook`
  - [FICO](https://github.com/fl-ada/FICO)
  - [Business Case 1-order](https://github.com/fl-ada/orderlist/blob/master/analysis_python.ipynb)
- `SQL`
  -[Business Case 1-order](https://github.com/fl-ada/orderlist/blob/master/analysis-sql.sql)
- `python` programming
- final year project `developing a library chatbot` [Report](/files/FYP_chatbot.pdf)

Each project/program will have a brief instruction on `readme` for better organization.
