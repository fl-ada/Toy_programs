# Toy_programs
This repository has the lists of toy projects I'd done.<br>
They are either school assignments, projects done with friends or by myself.

The list of main practices are
- `jupyter notebook`
- `SQL`
- `python` programming

Each project/program will have a brief instruction on `readme` for better organization.
